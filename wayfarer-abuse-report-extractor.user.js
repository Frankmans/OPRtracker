/*
 * v1.25.0 CHANGE FROM v1.24.1: restores the table column-width/truncation
 * constraint the old hand-rolled #wae-table had (max-width + ellipsis)
 * that quietly didn't carry over when the table switched to
 * WFMM.ui.table() -- see the STYLE block's own comment right above
 * ".wae-table{ table-layout: fixed; }" for the mechanics. Long content in
 * the Conversation/Wayspot Name columns (most commonly a URL that ended
 * up in the name field -- see the companion fix in opr-email-lib.js's
 * extractLocationLines() for that root cause) could otherwise blow a
 * column out wide enough to push Status/the nearby-flag column out of
 * view.
 *
 * v1.24.1 CHANGE FROM v1.24.0: renamed to "Wayfarer Map Mods - Abuse
 * Report Extractor" (@name, modal title, Plugin Manager listing, console
 * log prefixes) so it reads as clearly WFMM-affiliated wherever it shows
 * up standalone (Tampermonkey's dashboard, Plugin Manager's own list,
 * devtools console) -- not changed: @downloadURL/@updateURL/@require,
 * which point at actual filenames in the GitHub repo this is hosted from
 * and would break auto-update if renamed here without also renaming the
 * files there; the short in-panel settings-link text ("Abuse Report
 * Extractor"), left alone since it already sits inside a WFMM-branded
 * settings list where the full prefix would just be redundant; and every
 * internal identifier this doesn't actually display to a user -- PLUGIN_ID,
 * localStorage/IndexedDB keys, element ids -- since changing any of those
 * would orphan existing users' already-stored data.
 *
 * v1.24.0 CHANGE FROM v1.23.1: the "Conversation" and "Status" table
 * columns are now sortable -- using table()'s own built-in sortable-
 * header support (column.sortable/options.sortState/options.onSort,
 * confirmed against the real source), the same clickable-header-with-
 * \u25B2/\u25BC-marker look the suite's own tables use, rather than
 * anything custom-built here. Status sorts by pipeline stage (Received ->
 * Pending Review -> a settled state), not alphabetically -- see
 * WAE_STATUS_SORT_RANK just below WAE_STATUS_BADGES. The original
 * newest-scanned-first order is still what you get before either header's
 * been clicked; there's no third header to click back to it, though your
 * choice does persist across closing and reopening the panel (waeSortKey/
 * waeSortDirection are module-level, not reset on close) -- only a full
 * page reload clears it back to the default.
 *
 * v1.23.1 CHANGE FROM v1.23.0: adds a "Clickable markers" toggle to the
 * same Marker Style section -- backed by google.maps.Marker's own
 * setClickable(), not a WFMM.markerAppearance field (that registry is
 * about appearance, not interactivity, so this one setting is saved/
 * normalized alongside the appearance fields for convenience but isn't
 * part of what gets handed to registerStyle()'s resolve() -- harmless
 * either way, since normalizeResolvedStyle() only reads the six fields it
 * knows about and ignores extras, but kept the resolve() payload to just
 * those six for clarity). Turning it off drops the pointer cursor and
 * lets clicks reach whatever's underneath a marker instead of opening its
 * popup/zooming into its cluster.
 *
 * v1.23.0 CHANGE FROM v1.22.1: adds a "Marker Style" section to this
 * panel, letting the color/size/opacity of the map markers this plugin
 * draws be changed, backed by a real WFMM.markerAppearance.registerStyle()
 * registration (confirmed against the real source, src/core/marker-
 * appearance.js) rather than the hardcoded #dc2626 X/circle from earlier
 * versions. See the WAE_APPEARANCE_* block (just above waeGetMarkerIcon())
 * for the full "why this isn't a literal new row in Wayspot Overlay's own
 * Wayspots/Pok\u00e9stops/Gyms/Power Spots settings grid" explanation --
 * short version: that specific grid is hardcoded to those four kinds with
 * no third-party registration point, but the underlying styling ENGINE it
 * sits on top of is genuinely plugin-facing, and this now uses it.
 *
 * v1.22.0 CHANGE FROM v1.21.2: the panel was previously a hand-rolled
 * lookalike of a Map Mods modal -- its own "#wae-panel"/backdrop/dialog
 * DOM built from an innerHTML string, styled by reverse-engineering
 * (guessing at, then copying) the suite's own .wfmapmods-modal-* class
 * names rather than calling anything the suite actually exposes. Now that
 * the real suite source is available (Wayfarer_Map_Mods-4_1_20.txt),
 * confirmed it exposes a full UI service at window.WFMM.ui --
 * createElement/section/emptyState/table/pager/button/textInput/etc, and
 * critically a real openModal({id, title, buildContent, ...}) that builds
 * and manages the entire modal shell itself (backdrop, dialog, header,
 * close button, Escape/backdrop-click handling, focus return -- all of
 * it). Switched to that entirely -- buildPanel()'s manual backdrop/dialog
 * construction is gone; openPanel() now just calls WFMM.ui.openModal()
 * and builds the body content in buildContent() using WFMM.ui.createElement/
 * section/button/buttonRow/textInput/table/pager/emptyState/notice, and
 * closePanel()/togglePanel() work through the modalController it returns
 * instead of toggling a hidden panel's display style. Since openModal tears
 * the whole dialog down again on close (rather than just hiding it, the
 * way the old backdrop did), the panel's live DOM refs (count/table/log/
 * buttons) are now only valid while it's actually open -- tracked via a
 * single waeUI object, set in buildContent() and cleared in the onClose
 * hook, with refreshPanel()/waeRenderFilteredTable() now no-ops if it's
 * null instead of assuming document.getElementById() will find anything.
 *
 * Only the panel-*building* code changed -- scanning/matching (opr-email-
 * lib.js), the nearby-duplicate grid search, native-Marker map plotting,
 * and CSV export are untouched, since none of that is UI-service surface.
 * The nearby-ticket popover is still a manually-positioned floating
 * element (WFMM.ui has no floating-popover primitive to hand off to), but
 * its contents are now built with WFMM.ui.createElement instead of an
 * innerHTML string. The Google Maps InfoWindow content (waeShowPulseInfoWindow)
 * is deliberately left as a plain HTML string -- that's the Maps SDK's own
 * setContent() API, not this suite's modal system, so there's nothing to
 * hand off there.
 *
 * wfmmWindow (the unsafeWindow-vs-window resolution the Plugin Manager
 * registration already depended on) moved up to the top of the file so
 * the same reference can be reused for every WFMM.ui.* call in the panel,
 * not just the registration bootstrap at the bottom.
 *
 * Companion to wayfarer-abuse-email-importer.user.js. That script's job
 * stops at storing raw, unclassified emails; this one is the "different
 * plugin" mentioned while building it -- it does the actual work:
 *
 *   1. Reads every email already stored by the importer (WSTStorage.
 *      getAllEmails() -- same shared IndexedDB store, read-only from here).
 *   2. Classifies each with OPREmail.classify() and keeps only the ones
 *      that come back ABUSE_REPORT_* (Niantic Support's "Reporting Abuse
 *      in Wayfarer" Helpshift tickets -- see opr-email-lib.js's
 *      Style.SUPPORT section for how that classification works).
 *   3. Runs OPREmail.helpshift.parseAbuseReportEmail() on each one to pull
 *      out every reported Wayspot's name + coordinate (see `locations` in
 *      that function -- *** BEST-EFFORT, only confirmed against a
 *      handful of real samples *** -- the raw locationDetails/
 *      reportDetails text is kept alongside every row specifically so you
 *      can sanity-check or correct it by hand in the exported CSV). One
 *      ticket can report several Wayspots at once, or have more added in
 *      a later reply -- each becomes its own row, sharing the ticket's
 *      conversationId/issueType/raw-text columns.
 *   4. Stores the extracted rows in their OWN IndexedDB database (
 *      "wf-abuse-report-extract-db", separate from the importer's raw-
 *      email store, and from Tntnnbltn's own "wayfarer-tools-db" -- there
 *      was no reason to risk a version conflict opening a database this
 *      script doesn't own), keyed by conversation ID so re-scanning after
 *      importing more mail just updates rows in place rather than
 *      duplicating them.
 *   5. Exports everything currently stored as a CSV file (via a plain
 *      Blob + <a download>, no server round-trip).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here (out of scope for "extract + store + CSV"):
 *   - No map-plotting / Map Mods - Base integration. The importer script
 *     already exposes what you'd need for that
 *     (window.WayfarerAbuseEmailImporter.publishPoiToMap), so wiring a
 *     "show on map" button up here later is a small addition if you want
 *     it, not a redesign.
 *   - No editing UI for the extracted name/coordinates -- the raw text
 *     columns in the CSV are there so corrections happen in a spreadsheet,
 *     not in-page. Say the word if you'd rather have inline editing.
 *
 * v1.21.2 CHANGE FROM v1.21.1: fixed Plugin Manager registration silently
 * never happening -- same underlying issue as the importer script's own
 * v4.6.1 (see that file for the fuller explanation), except here the
 * cause was ambiguity rather than confirmed sandboxing: this script had
 * no @grant line at all, and while that's usually inferred as "none"
 * (unsandboxed), that inference isn't guaranteed identical across
 * userscript managers/versions. Added an explicit @grant none (removing
 * the ambiguity outright) and switched to reading through unsafeWindow
 * instead of window, same as the importer -- under @grant none these are
 * literally the same object per Tampermonkey's own docs, so this is
 * effectively a no-op safety net here, not a functional fix on its own,
 * but keeps both scripts' registration code identical and correct
 * regardless of which usage mode ends up applying.
 *
 * Same caveat as the importer script's v4.6.1: real userscript-manager
 * sandboxing can't be reproduced in this project's Node/jsdom test
 * harness, so this is grounded in Tampermonkey's documented behavior and
 * the specific reported symptom, not end-to-end verified. Worth
 * confirming directly against the real Plugin Manager screen.
 *
 * v1.21.1 CHANGE FROM v1.21.0: cluster markers (the numbered-badge
 * circles for multiple nearby reports) shrunk from 32x32 to 22x22, closer
 * to the 20x20 single-report marker, with a smaller count label to match.
 * Purely visual -- WAE_CLUSTER_PIXEL_RADIUS (the screen-pixel distance
 * that decides whether nearby reports group into one cluster at all)
 * is untouched, so this doesn't change *when* markers cluster, only how
 * big the resulting circle is.
 *
 * v1.21.0 CHANGE FROM v1.20.1: issueType/locationDetails/reportDetails
 * are genuinely per-TICKET, not per-location, but every location row was
 * storing its own full copy -- a 12-location ticket duplicated the same
 * raw text 12 times. Measured at a realistic 15,000-row/1,250-ticket
 * scale (matching a real report of this exact slowdown): storage dropped
 * from raw-JSON sizes of ~35MB estimated to a measured 7.06MB actual
 * (3.99MB extractedReports + 3.07MB the new ticketDetails store) once
 * split apart.
 *
 * New IndexedDB object store, ticketDetails (EXTRACT_DB_VERSION bumped to
 * 2), keyed by the same ticketKey every location row for that ticket now
 * carries (previously each row just duplicated the values directly).
 * getAllExtractedRecords() transparently joins the two stores back
 * together into the exact same record shape every existing caller
 * already expected -- search, table rendering, CSV export, nearby-
 * duplicate detection all needed zero changes, and there's no migration
 * step needed either, since Scan already rebuilds both stores from
 * scratch every time.
 *
 * Verified end-to-end through the real scan button, not just the
 * storage functions in isolation: confirmed ticketDetails ends up with
 * exactly one row per ticket (1,250, not 15,000), confirmed a location
 * row no longer stores locationDetails directly, and -- the part that
 * actually mattered for correctness -- searched for text that exists
 * ONLY in reportDetails and confirmed all 15,000 rows still matched,
 * proving the join correctly hydrates every row rather than only the
 * one row that happens to "own" the ticketDetails record. CSV export
 * also confirmed still includes the full raw text per row.
 *
 * v1.20.1 CHANGE FROM v1.20.0: replaced two remaining O(n) .find() calls
 * (the nearby-popover item click and the table row click) with O(1)
 * lookups against a new waeRecordsById Map, kept in sync alongside
 * waeAllRecords in refreshPanel(). Checked whether waeRefreshPulses()'s
 * per-zoom_changed coordinate filter was also worth caching -- benchmarked
 * at 0.8ms/pass over 15,000 records, ~16ms across 20 rapid zoom events --
 * genuinely negligible, left as-is rather than adding cache complexity
 * with no real benefit.
 *
 * v1.20.0 CHANGE FROM v1.19.0: fixed the panel itself (not the map) going
 * very slow once a real accumulated history got into the many thousands
 * of rows (real report: 15,000+). Benchmarked every piece of the
 * pipeline at that scale before touching anything -- nearby-duplicate
 * detection (75ms), clustering (35ms), and building the row HTML as a
 * plain string (78ms) all stayed fast; the actual cost was the browser
 * parsing/laying out that many real DOM rows at once (a ~3MB HTML
 * string via one innerHTML assignment), plus the search box recomputing
 * a fresh per-record searchable-text string AND re-rendering the entire
 * table on every single keystroke (measured ~180ms per keystroke
 * uncached at 15,000 rows).
 *
 * Fixes, in the order they matter:
 *   1. The table is now paginated -- WAE_PAGE_SIZE (200) rows rendered
 *      at a time regardless of how many total rows exist, with Prev/Next
 *      controls and a "Page X of Y (rows A-B of N)" label. This is the
 *      one that actually matters -- verified DOM row count stays at 200
 *      even with 15,000 records loaded, instead of all 15,000.
 *   2. Search input is now debounced (200ms) instead of filtering and
 *      re-rendering on every keystroke, and resets to page 1 on a new
 *      query so filtering never leaves you stranded on an out-of-range
 *      page.
 *   3. Each record's searchable text is now cached on first use
 *      (`r._waeHaystack`) instead of rebuilt from scratch on every
 *      filter pass -- naturally invalidates itself since a real data
 *      reload always produces fresh record objects from IndexedDB.
 *   4. The filtered+sorted view and the summary stats (location/ticket/
 *      coordinate counts) are now cached too, invalidated only when the
 *      underlying data or the search query actually changes (compared by
 *      array reference, cheap) -- confirmed via direct instrumentation
 *      that a plain Prev/Next page turn now hits this cache and does
 *      zero refiltering/resorting of the full dataset, rather than
 *      redoing that work to show 200 already-known rows.
 * Scan/Clear both reset to page 1, since the data (and likely the total
 * row count) just changed.
 *
 * v1.19.0 CHANGE FROM v1.18.0: fixed "Show on Map" getting slow again
 * once a real dataset grew into the hundreds -- the v1.12.0 native-Marker
 * fix and v1.13.0/v1.14.0 no-DB-read-on-pan fixes removed the WRONG
 * things (custom OverlayView repositioning, redundant IndexedDB reads);
 * they didn't address the actual remaining ceiling, which is that
 * rendering hundreds of individual Marker objects simultaneously has
 * real linear overhead (positioning, event listeners) no matter how
 * cheap any one of them is on its own -- confirmed this by checking
 * whether the suite's own map rendering does anything fundamentally
 * different for its own POI pins at scale; it doesn't (also plain
 * google.maps.Marker in the couple of spots that use one), which pointed
 * at the real fix being to render fewer markers at once, not a faster
 * marker technology.
 *
 * Added screen-pixel clustering: nearby records are grouped into a
 * single numbered-badge marker based on actual on-screen pixel distance
 * at the CURRENT zoom (not a fixed lat/lng radius, since the same real-
 * world distance covers wildly different pixel distances depending on
 * zoom) -- same grid-bucketing technique as the v1.13.0 nearby-duplicate
 * fix, just in pixel space. Clicking a cluster zooms in on it instead of
 * opening the info popup; a single-record "cluster" behaves exactly like
 * before. Recomputed on zoom_changed (a discrete, infrequent event, not
 * pan/drag) and after data changes -- diffed by a key derived from each
 * cluster's sorted member ids, so re-rendering at the same zoom with the
 * same data doesn't recreate markers needlessly.
 *
 * Verified with a synthetic 450-location dataset (30 tickets x 15
 * locations each, matching the real scale multi-location extraction
 * produces) through the actual button-click code path, not just the
 * clustering function in isolation: 21 markers rendered at a zoomed-out
 * level vs. 447 once zoomed in close enough to tell them apart -- and
 * confirmed the underlying clustering function alone handles 5,000
 * scattered records in ~125ms and a dense 750-record/50-cluster scenario
 * in single-digit milliseconds.
 *
 * v1.18.0 CHANGE FROM v1.17.0: two changes, same as the importer script's
 * own v4.6.0 (see that file for the fuller explanation of both).
 *   1. Added padding to the dialog -- .wfmapmods-modal-dialog itself
 *      provides none, confirmed against the real suite CSS, so content
 *      sat flush against the edges. Also overflow-y:auto so tall content
 *      scrolls instead of being clipped.
 *   2. Now registers as a real entry in the suite's Plugin Manager
 *      settings screen via window.WFMM.plugins.registerExternal(),
 *      falling back to the old self-start if that API never appears
 *      within 5s. stop() tears down the settings link, panel, side-panel
 *      watcher, map markers, and stale-map watch; start() rebuilds
 *      everything and resyncs the map if "Show on Map" was left on.
 *      Verified the full register+start+stop+restart cycle and the
 *      fallback path through a simulated DOM.
 *
 * v1.17.0 CHANGE FROM v1.16.0: adapted for Wayfarer's move to
 * wayfarer.scopely.com and Tntnnbltn's new consolidated
 * wayfarer-map-mods.user.js suite (v4.0.0, replacing the old separate
 * wayfarer-map-mods-base.user.js + Report Wayspots scripts this was
 * previously confirmed against). @namespace/@match updated to the new
 * domain. Verified the new suite's actual source line by line against
 * everything this script depends on -- #wfmapmods-side-panel,
 * .wfmapmods-settings-links, every .wfmapmods-modal-* class this uses,
 * and the map-lookup code's componentRef.map pattern + "app-submit-
 * wayspot-map nia-map, app-wf-base-map" selectors are all unchanged
 * (the last two are byte-for-byte what the new suite's own internal map
 * resolution uses too). No code changes needed in this file -- unlike
 * the importer script, this one never depended on the POI/submit bridge
 * (removed in the new suite) or the modal checkbox class (also removed).
 *
 * v1.16.0 CHANGE FROM v1.15.1: fixed long-running tickets losing data --
 * a ticket active enough to generate several separate email notifications
 * over time was only ever scanned from whichever single stored email
 * happened to be processed, even though each individual export only
 * contains THAT email's own quoted-history window, not the complete
 * conversation. Confirmed against two real exports of the same ticket a
 * week apart: the later one's quoted history didn't even reach back to
 * the original form submission anymore (its structured fields came back
 * completely empty), and each export's 10-message window covered
 * entirely different, non-overlapping stretches of an actively
 * back-and-forth conversation -- scanning either alone found 11 or 12
 * locations; scanning both together and merging finds the true 23.
 *
 * This was also silently DESTRUCTIVE, not just incomplete: every row's id
 * was based on conversationId alone ("conv:<id>:<index>"), so two
 * separate emails for the same ticket produced colliding ids, and
 * whichever one got written to storage second would silently overwrite
 * the other's rows at the same index rather than adding to them.
 *
 * Fixed by restructuring scanImportedEmails() into two passes: first
 * parse every stored email into its own thread and group by
 * conversationId, then merge each group's messages (opr-email-lib.js's
 * new mergeThreads() -- dedupes identical messages and re-sorts the
 * union newest-first by actual timestamp) before running extraction
 * (parseAbuseReportThread) and status classification
 * (classifyAbuseReportStatus) on that complete merged picture. One row
 * group per ticket now, never per individual email, so the id-collision
 * possibility is gone entirely rather than just less likely.
 * sourceEmailId/sourceFilename now list every contributing email
 * (semicolon-joined) instead of just one, since a row's data can
 * genuinely come from several. Verified through the actual scan button
 * click handler (not just the parsing functions in isolation) against
 * both real emails on hand, using a real IndexedDB implementation.
 *
 * v1.15.1 CHANGE FROM v1.15.0 (opr-email-lib.js fix, no code change in
 * this file, only the classification results it depends on): every
 * ticket was coming back Updated regardless of its actual reply text.
 * Cause: the "is the newest message from support" check tested for the
 * literal string "niantic support" in the author field, but that only
 * ever appears on the automated auto-ack -- a real human agent's reply
 * (including the actual decision messages this exists to classify) is
 * authored under their own name ("Jaxson", "Graham", ...), so it never
 * matched and every real closing reply fell through to the Updated
 * catch-all. Fixed to check for a non-blank author instead (the reliable
 * signal, per the blank-author fix elsewhere in that file: the REPORTER's
 * own messages have a blank author, every Niantic-side reply doesn't).
 * Confirmed against both real sample tickets on hand -- both now
 * correctly classify as Actioned instead of Updated -- plus all three
 * canned replies via synthetic transcripts. Deliberately still only
 * checks the single newest message, not previous replies in the thread,
 * per how this is meant to work: if the reporter sends a follow-up
 * *after* the real decision (e.g. a "thanks!"), status reads Updated
 * again since the newest message genuinely isn't one of the three
 * canned replies at that point -- a known limitation, not a bug.
 *
 * v1.15.0 CHANGE FROM v1.14.0: the Status column is now a friendly,
 * color-coded badge (Received/Pending Review/Actioned/Denied/Updated)
 * instead of a raw ABUSE_REPORT_* enum suffix -- reflects opr-email-
 * lib.js's confirmed-accurate three-way resolution classification (see
 * that file's own changelog note): Actioned and Denied both mean nothing
 * further to do here, Pending Review means revisit later. Also included
 * in search (querying "pending" now matches) and the CSV export.
 *
 * v1.14.0 CHANGE FROM v1.13.0: fixed markers not showing (or vanishing)
 * once you'd zoomed into a specific Wayspot -- Wayfarer's zoomed-in
 * submit/edit view uses a genuinely different map component
 * (app-submit-wayspot-map) with its own separate google.maps.Map object
 * than the general mapview (app-wf-base-map); waeGetWfMap() already had
 * to query for both. A Marker only ever renders on the one Map object it
 * was created against, so switching between those views made every
 * marker silently disappear, with nothing re-attaching automatically
 * until "Show on Map" was manually toggled off and on again. Added a
 * lightweight watch (2s interval, only running while pins are toggled
 * on) that notices the map object going stale and re-attaches + rebuilds
 * on its own. Cheap by design -- waeIsMapStale() is a trivial DOM check,
 * and real work only happens on the rare tick where the map actually
 * changed -- so this doesn't reintroduce the per-pan/zoom cost the
 * v1.12.0/v1.13.0 fixes removed.
 *
 * v1.13.0 CHANGE FROM v1.12.0: fixed the panel hanging (visible as a
 * white screen while it's blocked mid-open) once enough data had
 * accumulated. Two compounding causes:
 *   1. refreshPanel() recomputed the nearby-duplicate map unconditionally
 *      -- including on every plain panel OPEN, not just when data
 *      actually changed. With a few thousand accumulated rows (easy to
 *      reach given one ticket can extract 15-20+ locations) that
 *      recompute alone measured ~2.4s at 10,000 rows. It's now skipped
 *      unless the record set's fingerprint (count + latest scannedAt)
 *      actually changed since last time -- opening the panel again with
 *      nothing new to show now does zero duplicate-detection work.
 *   2. waeFindNearbyDuplicates() itself was a full O(n^2) pairwise scan.
 *      Rewritten to bucket records into a ~111m lat/lng grid and only
 *      compare each record against its 3x3 cell neighborhood -- real
 *      locations spread across a country mean most pairs are nowhere
 *      near each other, so this is close to O(n) in practice. Confirmed:
 *      same output as the old pairwise version on a known test case,
 *      ~37x faster at 10,000 rows (2.4s -> 65ms), and a dense
 *      1000-point same-cell cluster still resolves in ~30ms.
 *
 * v1.12.0 CHANGE FROM v1.11.0: fixed "Show on Map" getting slow with more
 * than a couple dozen markers. Two separate causes, both fixed:
 *   1. waeRefreshPulses() called getAllExtractedRecords() (a full
 *      IndexedDB read) itself, and ran on every 'idle' AND 'zoom_changed'
 *      map event -- i.e. a full DB read + marker rebuild on every single
 *      pan/zoom. It now reads from waeAllRecords (already kept in sync by
 *      refreshPanel() after every scan/clear) instead, and the 'idle'
 *      listener is gone entirely -- see point 2, it's no longer needed
 *      for anything.
 *   2. Markers were a custom google.maps.OverlayView (own div, manual
 *      draw()/projection math). An OverlayView's draw() runs on every
 *      projection update for every instance -- including continuously
 *      during a drag, not just once per pan -- so with dozens of markers
 *      that's dozens of synchronous DOM writes per drag frame. Switched
 *      to native google.maps.Marker (own SVG icon, same red-X look) --
 *      positioned by the Maps SDK itself, no per-frame JS callback
 *      involved, and no pan/zoom listener needed at all to stay correctly
 *      placed. zoom_changed now only toggles .setMap() on already-built
 *      markers for the <8-zoom clutter gate -- cheap, no data fetch, no
 *      marker recreation.
 *
 * v1.11.0 CHANGE FROM v1.10.0: the ⚠️ nearby-duplicate flag is now
 * clickable instead of just a hover tooltip -- opens a small popover
 * listing each nearby ticket by name/distance, and clicking one jumps the
 * map straight to THAT specific match (same waeGoToLocation() a table row
 * click uses), so you can actually go compare the two rather than just
 * being told they're close. A plain title="..." can't hold clickable
 * content, so this is a real floating element (position:fixed, appended
 * to document.body, since the table's own scroll container would clip
 * anything positioned inside it) -- closes on an outside click, Escape,
 * picking an item, or the panel itself closing.
 *
 * v1.10.0 CHANGE FROM v1.9.0: rows are now flagged (\u26A0\uFE0F, plus a subtle
 * row highlight) when their coordinates fall within 20m (Haversine,
 * WAE_NEARBY_THRESHOLD_METERS) of a location extracted from a DIFFERENT
 * ticket -- the same spot reported more than once, independently.
 * Deliberately NOT flagged against each other: multiple locations within
 * one ticket's own thread -- that's the expected multi-location shape
 * this tool already handles, not a duplicate to notice. Computed once
 * per data refresh (scan/clear), not per search keystroke -- it's O(n^2)
 * over records-with-coordinates, cheap at this tool's usual scale but no
 * reason to redo it on every filter change. Also exposed as a new
 * "Nearby Tickets" CSV column, computed at export time.
 *
 * v1.9.0 CHANGE FROM v1.8.0: added a search box above the table. Filters
 * in-memory against the already-fetched record list (no IndexedDB
 * round-trip per keystroke) across name, conversation ID, comment, issue
 * type, both raw text fields, and the source filename/email id -- not
 * just the visible columns, since a query is more likely to hit the raw
 * locationDetails/reportDetails text than the best-guess name. Filtering
 * only changes what's displayed; Export CSV, Show on Map, and the
 * summary counts still reflect everything, not just the visible rows.
 *
 * v1.8.0 CHANGE FROM v1.7.0: every table row with coordinates is now
 * clickable -- jumps the map to that location (centers, zooms in to 17 if
 * more zoomed out than that) and shows the InfoWindow there, regardless
 * of whether "Show on Map" pins are toggled on. Since the panel is a
 * full-screen backdrop, clicking a row also closes it -- otherwise the
 * map you just navigated would be sitting invisible behind the modal.
 * Rows with no parseable coordinates aren't clickable (nothing to jump
 * to). Reuses the same map-attachment code "Show on Map" already ported
 * from Report Wayspots -- no new map-detection logic needed.
 *
 * v1.7.0 CHANGE FROM v1.6.0: markers are now a static red X (two rotated
 * bars, class .wae-report-marker) instead of the animated expanding-ring
 * pulse v1.6.0 shipped with -- at your request. No animation/keyframes
 * left in the CSS. Same OverlayView plumbing, click-for-InfoWindow
 * behavior, and localStorage-persisted toggle as before -- only the
 * marker's own look changed.
 *
 * v1.6.0 CHANGE FROM v1.5.0: added a "Show on Map" toggle that plots
 * every extracted location as a red cross marker directly on the Wayfarer
 * map -- the same thing Report Wayspots does for its own reported-
 * wayspot history, but for what THIS script extracted from imported
 * emails, and without needing Report Wayspots installed at all. Base
 * itself has no marker-plotting API (its own map-lookup is module-scoped,
 * same as Report Wayspots' copy), so this ports Report Wayspots'
 * confirmed-working getWfMap()/extractMapFromCtxEntry() map-detection
 * code and builds a self-contained google.maps.OverlayView marker layer
 * (own CSS classes/color, kept distinct from Report Wayspots' so the two
 * don't read as the same layer). Unlike Report Wayspots' pulses, these
 * are clickable -- shows name/coordinates/comment/ticket in an
 * InfoWindow, since dozens of nearby entries would otherwise be
 * indistinguishable. The toggle's on/off state persists in localStorage
 * and re-attaches automatically on page load if it was left on; pins stay
 * in sync automatically after every scan or clear while it's on.
 *
 * v1.5.0 CHANGE FROM v1.4.0: Street View / Maps links found near a
 * location in a reply (real example: "'t Zudn, <lat,lng> (is here:
 * <corrected lat,lng>, shows on street view: <url>)") used to be dropped
 * outright as unreliable "new location" noise. They're kept now -- folded
 * into a new `comment` field on whichever named location they were
 * providing context for (see opr-email-lib.js's extractLocationLines) --
 * and exposed as a new "Comment" CSV column, plus a hover-for-full-text
 * 💬 indicator in the panel's table.
 *
 * v1.4.0 CHANGE FROM v1.3.0: a ticket reporting several Wayspots at once,
 * or with more added in a later reply ("I see I missed some: ..."), now
 * produces one CSV row per Wayspot instead of just one row for the
 * ticket. This follows from opr-email-lib.js's parseAbuseReportEmail()
 * now returning a `locations` array (deduped by coordinate) instead of a
 * single locationName/primaryCoordinate guess -- see that file's own
 * comments for how it's built (the original form's locationDetails field,
 * split per line, plus every reply message scanned the same way).
 * Because a ticket's row count can now change between scans, "Scan
 * Imported Emails" rebuilds the extracted-data store from scratch each
 * time (clearExtractedRecords() then a fresh write) rather than upserting
 * -- upserting alone would've left old single-row ids behind as stale
 * duplicates once a ticket started producing several rows.
 *
 * v1.3.0 CHANGE FROM v1.2.0: the panel is now a real modal, styled with
 * Base's own .wfmapmods-modal-* classes (backdrop, dialog, title, close
 * button, buttons) instead of the old custom fixed-position dark/monospace
 * box. Centered, white, blocks the rest of the page while open (click
 * outside the dialog, Escape, or the × all close it) -- matching every
 * other Map Mods - Base panel (Map options, Manual marker options, etc.)
 * instead of looking and behaving like a standalone floating widget.
 *
 * v1.2.0 CHANGE FROM v1.1.0: dropped the @require for Tntnnbltn's
 * wayfarer-map-mods-base.user.js that pulled Base in directly. @require
 * re-executes the whole required file separately inside *each* userscript
 * that lists it, rather than sharing one running instance -- with both this
 * script and the Abuse Email Importer requiring it, that meant two
 * independent copies of Base on the same page, each building its own
 * "#wfmapmods-side-panel" (Base has no re-init guard against a second,
 * separately-required copy). Report Wayspots -- Base's real companion
 * script -- never @requires it either: it's installed once, standalone,
 * and talks to whatever single copy is already running purely through the
 * DOM contract (.wfmapmods-settings-links, the bridge elements). This
 * script now does the same -- Map Mods - Base needs to be installed
 * separately for the settings-link and side panel to have anywhere to go.
 *
 * v1.1.0 CHANGE FROM v1.0.0: this no longer has its own floating button.
 * Confirmed against Report Wayspots v3.3.0's real source -- how it adds its
 * own "Reporting History" / "Reporting Settings" entries -- Map Mods -
 * Base's side panel has a settings-links section
 * (".wfmapmods-settings-links") that any script sharing the page can just
 * appendChild a plain <a> into, once "#wfmapmods-side-panel" exists (found
 * via the same debounced MutationObserver pattern Report Wayspots uses).
 * There's no dedicated modal API to go with it, though -- Report Wayspots'
 * own openModal() is that script's local helper, not something Base
 * exposes -- so the panel itself is unchanged (same fixed-position box,
 * same Scan/Export/Clear buttons and table), just opened via that new
 * "Abuse Report Extractor" link in Base's settings section instead, with a
 * close (✕) button added since there's no toggle button to click again.

  // modal.js) is hardcoded to those four built-in kinds -- STYLE_KINDS in
  // src/plugins/wayspot-overlay/settings.js is a frozen array, with no
  // registration point for a third-party plugin to add a new row/column.
  // There's no real API path to literally insert into that specific grid.
  // What IS real and plugin-facing is the underlying engine that grid is
  // built on (WFMM.markerAppearance.registerStyle()/.resolve()) -- so
  // this plugin registers its own style bucket there (a legitimate use of
  // real public API, confirmed against source) and gets its OWN "Marker
  // Style" section in this panel to edit it, using the same
  // colorInput/numberInput/rangeInput controls the suite's own settings
  // screens use. Same underlying engine, same look, own section -- not a
